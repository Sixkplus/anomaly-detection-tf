# 1. Convert the training videos to .npy version in frame-level and put them in `training_data` dir using `videoToFrames.py` and `imagesToData_v2.py`.

# 2. Similar operations for testing videos

# 3. Edit parameters in `model.py`

# 4. Run `train.py` to training the model

# 5. Run `test.py` to obtain the rugularity in both spatial and temporal level

# 6. In `show_output.ipynb`, visualize the output and obtain the ROC curve.
